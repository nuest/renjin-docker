# renjin-docker

Dockerfiles for automatic builds on Docker Hub for Renjin, an interpreter for R built on the Java Virtual Machine.

For more information on **Renjin**, please visit http://www.renjin.org.

Images on Docker Hub: [https://hub.docker.com/r/nuest/renjin](https://hub.docker.com/r/nuest/renjin)

## Run Renjin in container

By default, the image is set up to [use Renjin interactively](http://docs.renjin.org/en/latest/interactive/index.html) and an R session is automatically started.

```bash
docker run -it --rm nuest/renjin
> R.version
> q()
```

Stopping the session also stops the container.

You can also start renjin manually and see how R packages are automatically loaded when using `library(..)` and installed into `~/.m2/repository/org/renjin/cran/`.

```
$ docker run -it nuest/renjin /bin/bash
# renjin

> library("dplyr")

# based on https://rpubs.com/davoodastaraky/mtRegression
> mtcars$amfactor <- factor(mtcars$am, labels = c("automatic", "manual"))
> summary(lm(mpg ~ factor(amfactor), data = mtcars))$coef
