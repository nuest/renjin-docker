Dockerfiles for automatic builds on Docker Hub for **[Renjin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renjin)** ([https://www.renjin.org/](https://www.renjin.org/)), an interpreter for [R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)) built on the [Java Virtual Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine).

Images on Docker Hub: [https://hub.docker.com/r/nuest/renjin](https://hub.docker.com/r/nuest/renjin)

## Run Renjin in container

By default, the image is set up to [use Renjin interactively](http://docs.renjin.org/en/latest/interactive/index.html) and an R session is automatically started.

```bash
docker run -it --rm nuest/renjin
> R.version
> q()
```

Stopping the session also stops the container.

You can also start renjin manually and see how R packages are automatically loaded when using `library(..)` and installed into `~/.m2/repository/org/renjin/cran/`.

```
$ docker run -it nuest/renjin /bin/bash
# renjin

> library("dplyr")
> mtcars$amfactor <- factor(mtcars$am, labels = c("automatic", "manual"))
> summary(lm(mpg ~ factor(amfactor), data = mtcars))$coef
> quit()

# ls /root/.m2/repository/org/renjin/cran/
# exit
```

## Local build

Go into the version directory, then:

```bash
docker build --tag renjin .
docker run -it renjin
```

## Versions

Different Renjin versions are supported as tags.
The most recent version is taken from the [Renjin Nexus](https://nexus.bedatadriven.com/#view-repositories;public~browsestorage~org.renjin), see `org.renjin.renjin-debian-package`.
You can pull all tags to your local machine to get a list of available versions:


```bash
docker pull -a nuest/renjin
docker images | grep nuest/renjin
```
